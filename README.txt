- Developed using Visual Studio 2015

- normalize() and sort() functions had to be 
made non-static to deal with assigning GUI 
object values

- Failed attempt at normalize() function for
any number of values can be found in the 
commented out normalize2() function after
line 135 of Form1.cs

- Chosen Sorting Algorithm: Insertion Sort
  
  Usually quicker and less 
  processor-intensive than Bubble Sort
  
  Usually slower and more 
  processor-intensive than a Quicksort
