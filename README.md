# Number Manipulator #

The Number Manipulator is a legacy Project refactored to adhere to better coding principles. Its purpose is to demonstrate the variety of manipulation that can be made to a comma-separated list of numbers.

### Insertion Sort ###

The chosen algorithm for sorting is the Insertion Sort. This Sorting Algorithm is quicker and less processor-intensive than a Bubble sort. It is also slower and more processor-intensive than a Quicksort. For the purposes of a small program like this the efficiency of this algorithm is not important.
